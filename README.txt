This is a simple ray caster written in JR, an extended version of Java with superior parallelization capabilities. If you wish to recompile my source, you will need to install JR on your own system (see the link below for more information on JR including where to download it and how to set it up) but I have also included the compiled binaries which can be run with java. To run, navigate into jrGen in the src folder and run with 'java Main'.

Controls:
w = forward
s = backward
a = strafe left
d = strafe right

j = look left
k = look right

While the it is currently not in a particularly impressive state, it would be easy to expand it greatly from here. Adding textures would be trivial and the map can be enlarged and customized easily by using node tags.
